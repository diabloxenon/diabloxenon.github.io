# XLD's Journal

## Basic journal howto from Xenon Lucifer Diablo to everyone

Hi there, this repository is a holder to my journal with periodic updates.
If you want to save it **offline** for any purposes:

1. `git clone https://github.com/diabloxenon/diabloxenon.github.io xld_journal`
2. `cd xld_journal`
3. `python -m http.server`

This will spawn a basic http server enough for reading the journal properly.

That's all folks! Your support matters a lot to me and is greatly appreciated. This journal works on donations completely, so I would really appreciate if you could spare some change for this and help a brother out. Donation link here https://nmnx.org/donate
