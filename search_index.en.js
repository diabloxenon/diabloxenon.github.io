The 101 series of this journal is to present things that I find everyone should know about that particular language. So, let's start with our favorite Rust ❤️.\nWhat is Bitfield?\nBitfields are simple data structures, which is used to define standard properties or to enable features inside a function or a program. Typically, they are used at a lower level of the machine.\nFor example, the microcontroller inside an Arduino (idk if you are familiar with it) uses very low memory and store space. So, we need to design a particular set of options or states that are to be enabled once that bit is on.\nHere we will consider a 8-bit solution which can be defined using memory space of only a single byte and assignable via u8 type in Rust which is represented as 1111 1111\nLet's arbitrarily take 8 options that we want for a program we need to develop for a factory robotic arm, suppose:\n\nBit 1: Toggles power to arm\nBit 2: Grabs the current item from assembly line\nBit 3: Skip to next item\nBit 4: Back to previous item\nBit 5: Put the item on rejected line\nBit 6: Put the item on assembly line\nBit 7: Flips the item upside down (reverses it)\nBit 8: Shakes the item\n\nNow, we have 8 options that we want to consider for a particular operation:\nOperation 1: Grabs the current item and rejects it\nWe need 3 bits enabled in this case, Bit 1 OR Bit 2 OR Bit 5. Doing this, our bitmap will look something like 0001 0011\nOperation 2: Grabs the current item, shakes it, flips it and put it back\nWe need 5 bits enabled for this operation, Bit 1 OR Bit 2 OR Bit 6 OR Bit 7 OR Bit 8. In this case, our bitmap will be like this 1110 0011\nUsage of Bitfields in Rust\nThere are 2 ways of programming bitfields in Rust\n\nUsing structures\nUsing enumerators\n\nUsing Structures\nBitfields used in structures are based on concept of associated constants, which uses direct association instead of type conversion of different variants. This calls for an easy comparison of bitfields without type casting it everytime.\npub struct RoboticArmProperties;\n\nimpl RoboticArmProperties {\n    pub const POWER: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 0;\n    pub const GRAB_ASSEMBLY: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 1;\n    pub const SKIP_TO_NEXT: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 2;\n    pub const BACK_TO_PREV: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 3;\n    pub const PUT_REJECTED: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 4;\n    pub const PUT_ASSEMBLY: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 5;\n    pub const VERTICAL_FLIP: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 6;\n    pub const SHAKES: u8 = 1 &lt;&lt; 7;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let operation_1 = RoboticArmProperties::POWER\n        | RoboticArmProperties::GRAB_ASSEMBLY\n        | RoboticArmProperties::PUT_REJECTED;\n    let operation_2 = RoboticArmProperties::POWER\n        | RoboticArmProperties::GRAB_ASSEMBLY\n        | RoboticArmProperties::PUT_ASSEMBLY\n        | RoboticArmProperties::VERTICAL_FLIP\n        | RoboticArmProperties::SHAKES;\n    println!(\"Enabling Operation 1: {}\", operation_1);\n    println!(\"Enabling Operation 2: {}\", operation_2);\n}\n\nUsing Enumerators\nWe will use enumerators to create new properties and adding them together as a single typeform using #[repr(u8)] macro which declares the bits to u8 type.\nFurthermore, to use these bitfields, we have to again typecast the enum variants to properly get our assigned values.\n#[repr(u8)]\npub enum RoboticArmProperties {\n    Power = 1 &lt;&lt; 0,\n    GrabAssembly = 1 &lt;&lt; 1,\n    SkipToNext = 1 &lt;&lt; 2,\n    BackToPrev = 1 &lt;&lt; 3,\n    PutRejected = 1 &lt;&lt; 4,\n    PutAssembly = 1 &lt;&lt; 5,\n    VerticalFlip = 1 &lt;&lt; 6,\n    Shakes = 1 &lt;&lt; 7,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let operation_1 = RoboticArmProperties::Power as u8\n        | RoboticArmProperties::GrabAssembly as u8\n        | RoboticArmProperties::PutRejected as u8;\n    let operation_2 = RoboticArmProperties::Power as u8\n        | RoboticArmProperties::GrabAssembly as u8\n        | RoboticArmProperties::PutAssembly as u8\n        | RoboticArmProperties::VerticalFlip as u8\n        | RoboticArmProperties::Shakes as u8;\n    println!(\"Enabling Operation 1: {}\", operation_1);\n    println!(\"Enabling Operation 2: {}\", operation_2);\n}\n\n","id":"https://nmnx.org/journal/101/bitfields-101/","title":"Bitfields Demystified"},"https://nmnx.org/journal/101/sizes-101/":{"body":"Sizes are an important topic to discuss, because at the end of the day while creating some arbitrary data structure you are going to be in trouble if dealing with FFIs or foreign interfaces. What I have done here is to preassign few data types that I use frequently.\n\nLet's start with a simple binary. Suppose, you are going to create a very light structure with predicable memory size, we will call it Baby.\npub struct Baby{\n    head: bool,\n    limbs: u8\n}\n\nThe problem arises here is we do not know the size of this structure at the runtime. Now, there are literally so many solutions to this problem but the key tip here, for this is to simple use the Rust's builtin library std::mem.\nfn main() {\n    let size_obj = std::mem::size_of::&lt;Baby&gt;();\n    println!(\"Your baby is {} long. Such cuteness!\", size_obj);\n}\n\nTry this and you will get the size for the Baby. Doesn’t matter if its a baby of Human or a Dog or a Tiger.

Here am I, presenting what to do if you are one of those unlucky guy/gal out there.\n\nAnnoying thing is these scammers don't take shame in their crafty new tricks to fool the technologically illiterate people.\nOur victim today was a friend of mine, who uses smartphones like shit 💩. Bear with me, he is the same age as of me bit on the older side tho. So anyways, he showed me his phone saying that he is receiving strange notifications on his phone, almost like its hacked or something. That's when I saw this hideous contraption and I can't even express my disgust to even call this a hack. That's like insulting the art of hacking in itself.\nIn short, this was a malicious adware but so crafty that you average joe might consider it a virus or something. A good social engineering effort tho.\nKnowing the victim's activities, the payload mentioned here found its way into his device by opening an attachment thinking about a Zoom meeting link but actually the file was of extension .ical.\nThat executed the payload inside his phone as an iCalendar account which resolved my question of how the notifications are updating themselves everyday. This was really simple, as the iCalendar account was actually an API from which the notifications were fetching into the victim's device.\nSimple deletion of the malicious account resolved the problem.\nIf anyone of you are suffering from the same thing, just go to iOS Settings &gt; Calendar &gt; Accounts &gt; [THE MALICIOUS ACCOUNT] &gt; Delete Account. You can find the API link in Account &gt; Server, just copy the link and paste it into your finding repo.\nAlso, please do share your findings with me too, coz I love torturing scammers :smiling_face_with_horns: and for any buddy here who wants to do some analysis over this, here's the bone!\nhttp://msgle.com/api/v1/subscriber/fd6b26f1-a4c5-453c-9b0c-4c43a7315a99/calendar\n\nRead my other entries for more juicy content!\nSee ya for now 👋\n","id":"https://nmnx.org/journal/calendar-spam/","title":"iPhone Calendar Spam"},"https://nmnx.org/journal/dawei/":{"body":"Hey umm..., Do you know da wei???

This includes the drive name too, so make sure you are using the correct drive to work with as THIS WILL REALLY FUCK UP YOUR DATA IF DONE WRONG.\n# Match the device id and its size mentioned in outupt with your corresponding drive.\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nStep 1: Wipe the headers\nSome drives even after wiping will have associated partition table information that can result in corruption of data and in many cases making drive invalid. To clean this, wipefs utility will be used.\n# Make sure to select the correct device\nsudo wipefs -af /dev/sde\n\nStep 2: Remove GPT data\nIf you are using a Linux on a modern machine (with UEFI enabled), there is a high chance that your drive contains GPT (GUID Partition Table) in it. To clean this, sgdisk utility will be used.\n# Again, select the right device\nsudo sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sde\n\nStep 3: Clean the remnants of partition\nSometimes to protect drive from corruption, there are backup of partition tables on specific locations. This can cause faulty overwrites with the old partitioning to the new, if cloning an image. Good example of this is if flashing different Raspberry Pi images on same SD card. To clean this, shred command will be used.\nThis command will select a random source, in our case /dev/urandom and overwrite the bits on drive from random source.\n# Last time, check if device is right. No crying afterwards!\nsudo shred --verbose --random-source=/dev/urandom --iterations=1 /dev/sde\n\nStep 4: Verify image checksum\nNo matter from where you have downloaded disk image, you should always verify the image's hash signature only if obtained from trusted sources.\n# Use the checksum only if the source obtained from is trusted.\nsha1sum &lt;file_name.iso&gt;\nmd5 &lt;file_name.iso&gt;\n# match the output of the command with your checksum\n\nFinal Step: Let's clone it!\nOkay, so the final part is here.

Now get back up there by removing #you-are-here and typing #headlines and you know the drill.\nUPDATE\nStarting with nmnx.org v2.0, we provide default search engine to type your queries into, but still you are learned something that might help you in another ways ;)\n","id":"https://nmnx.org/journal/intro/","title":"Day one"},"https://nmnx.org/journal/just-random-things/":{"body":"Random things aren't random at all. Sometimes, it might be difficult for your beloved PC to generate a proper entropy for things that needs to be random. We will explore the solution behind this peculiar problem.\n\nLike all things in this universe are random, your PC might annoy you for things like it can't find any random entropy and all. This is an error and it is random, like all things are (should have said something random)!\nIn this journal entry, we will discuss what should you do when this kind of problem occurs.\n1. Check if your system is generating proper entropy\nTo verify, we always see the entropy is in between of certain threshold values. For a healthy system, our entropy should around 4,096 which is the poolsize for your kernel. You can verify this by:\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize\n\nThis will output the upper limit of your poolsize, before it is again dumped out and becomes zero. System can be said faulty, if its entropy falls below 250 even after long run. Therefore, a good region is 1024 &lt; entropy &lt; 4096. For the values mentioned above, you can refer to the this entry. Check your system's entropy with the following command:\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n\nIf your entropy is not in the region, then there below mentioned is the solution you should try with.\n2. Pseudorandom number generator (PRNGs)\nPreviously, we have already discussed this before in this journal entry where we talked about how /dev/random is slower than /dev/urandom. This is because of less entropy collection done by /dev/random since it only collects from less frequent devices (Keyboard interrupts, Mouse motion, disk accesses) etc. Your system may partake in less generation of entropy due to this reason (in cases for servers and CLI based environments). However, there is considerablity for the solution of external (more faster) random number generation. Now now, you won't be needing any specialized hardware setup (although these things exists) for you to generate some random keys. Your processor manufacturer, already provides a TRNG hardware inside it.\nPrograms like rng-tools, Yarrow (co-devised by Bruce Schneier), Fortuna (successor of Yarrow, implemented in FreeBSD)\nAnother good thing I would like to mention is, rng-tools, Haveged, Frandom are not suitable for long-term cryptographic keys as mentioned here in this documentation. The community have clearly explained this in their documentation, I am only making it brief.\nTRNGs are known in the industry to not generate numbers that random. See Schneier's article on\n3. /dev/random vs /dev/urandom verdict\nThis RFC4086 have also described it well on how the Linux kernel generates randomness for /dev/random by input data from various devices, along with their techniques.\nA proper seed generation is always a must to ensure that random bits generated are always different in long term. This is ensured by the kernel by using cryptographically secure PRNG.\nHowever, to quote from the RFC mentioned, I would like to mention this decade old argument on which one is safe. As mentioned on page 29 of this RFC:\n\n/dev/urandom works like /dev/random; however, it provides data even\nwhen the entropy estimate for the random pool drops to zero. This\nmay be adequate for session keys or for other key generation tasks\nfor which blocking to await more random bits is not acceptable. The\nrisk of continuing to take data even when the pool's entropy estimate\nis small in that past output may be computable from current output,\nprovided that an attacker can reverse SHA-1. Given that SHA-1 is\ndesigned to be non-invertible, this is a reasonable risk.\n\nIn simpler terms, /dev/urandom can be used to generate short term private keys (i.e. for sessions, token, otp, etc.) but /dev/random should be used in cases of keys that cannot be replaced often, like your (LUKS keyfile, SSH keys, GPG keys, etc.). But then again this is a sincere advice from my side, however should the opinions matters yet again, I would advice to refer to this point then.\nIf you feel like something else should also have been mentioned in this entry, feel free to email me about.\nThat's all for today!

No, I am not talking about \"Light Machine Gun\", this is called Lean Mean Green style of coding-fu.\n\nSo, I will tell you the philosophy behind this word. Truth is, I was reading the Dokkōdō and it kinda made me thinking about my own choices in path of my life and it brought the question into my mind, which I asked earlier of you. So, I derived this term Lean Mean Green to instantiate a simple way of coding style that one can follow during his journey.\nLean means simple and slim, like a cut of lean meat, the code consists of basic tasks and algorithms representing as simple as possible.\nMean means meaning. Hehe, too much mean in one sentence eh? The code is in itself descriptive and functional, basically it does one job what it tells you about and does it perfectly well. Fact: UNIX also follows same philosophy.\nGreen is the green matter of code i.e. Documentation. Without proper commenting and documentation in between functions, the code is like a spaghetti without meatballs/veggies/seasoning or a pizza without pepperoni/olives etc. if you know what I mean.\nOh and btw, don't think that you should not pursue the taste of good food. Once in a while, you gotta enjoy your life and change your daily game. Like I use to say and you can quote me on this:\n\nLife is a video game, where you have only one life\n&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Xenon Lucifer Diablo\n\n","id":"https://nmnx.org/journal/lmg-style/","title":"Lean Mean Green"},"https://nmnx.org/journal/wipe-disks/":{"body":"Hi again, today in this NOOB friendly Privacy series of my journal, I will be discussing a good, trusted way to wipe disks off. Including your precious SSD or that god awful HDD from your grandma's PC which you wanna sell on ebay for couple of bucks. This is must.\n\nBy this time we know how power hungry people really are and data is power so, people starve to get some data off of you that they will even try to recover your deleted files and stuff.\nWhether you are an hacktivist or just some normal office guy following protocols of your glorious company or you wanna sell your computer/laptop/drive to anyone. You should wipe this off like you are washing your hands with the soap (OH NO!! Another Coronavirus reference LOL).\nBefore proceeding to it and regretting later, Read notes below\nGood steps to follow\n\n\nInstall pipeview pv (thank me later). I dunno which distro you use so figure yourself out how to install for that.\n\n\nDone that? Good coz its only the fun stuff now.\n\n\nFun part is...\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom | pv | sudo dd of=/dev/&lt;disk_you_love&gt;\n\n\n\nGo grab your favorite drink! Or if you are still here, see the explanation below.\n\n\nExplaination for the big brains (190 &lt; you_are_here &lt; 200)\nThis just overwrites every bit written on the disk with that of the random values generated by kernel. Some people might even say this: \n\n/dev/urandom is cryptographically insecure. I will rather use /dev/random. Its the reason why I win that poker match last night.\n\nDon't, Just Don't. Okay? You will regret that decision immediately. See notes below\nOne more thing, for SSDs there will be few writes i.e. the max capacity of it but that doesn't limit your TBWs necessarily. It's one time thing before you either buy or sell your old drive on craigslist.\nFew Notes\n\n\nJust remember one itsy bitsy thing, do try this first on any spare drive rather on your system disk, just to experiment before if you are complete NOOB monkey. I ain't responsible for any destruction you cause either on your system or anything to this world.\n\n\nAlso before initiating, do not do this on already formatted partitions otherwise everything, including your formatting of drive will be overwritten. \n\n\nA common misconception lies where people start to believe on the hearsay of /dev/urandom vs /dev/random. It's true that /dev/urandom is faster than /dev/random but that doesn't mean it is somehow inferior to that.\n\n\nTL;DR /dev/random is good for generation of one time keys due to necessary entropy required for that, whereas /dev/urandom is better when you require fast generation of numbers, so as not to make kernel wait in collection of required entropy for insignificant things. Waiting for kernel to generate proper entropy could cause potential deadlocks.\n\n\nThat's all for now!
